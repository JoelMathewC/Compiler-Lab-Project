# Compiler-Lab-Project
As a part of my Compiler Lab course in S6, I built a compiler for a language called Expl. The machine code generated was run on the XSM machine. The code was written in C, using the lex tool for generating a lexical analyzer and the yacc tool for generating a parser. More details are available at https://silcnitc.github.io/

Properties of the language include
 1. Support for functions
 2. Support for dynamic memory allocation
 3. Support for Pointers and multidimensional array
 4. Support for structures
 5. Support for Classes
 6. Support for single inheritance (with subtype polymorphism and function overloadi
